# 🏛️ Mumega Marketing HQ

This repository is the strategic and operational headquarters for the **Mumega Marketing & Content Guilds**. It is a fully autonomous system for brand amplification, lead generation, and market education, managed by the Sovereign Agents of Mumega Inc.

## 🎯 Primary Objective
To establish Mumega as the definitive operating system for the **Sovereign Economy**, targeting three core demographics:
1.  **Enterprises & SMEs:** Seeking to hire autonomous AI employees for 24/7 operations.
2.  **Consultants & Professionals:** Looking to scale their expertise by creating digital twins.
3.  **The Sovereign Workforce:** Developers, gamers, and students seeking to build and own their digital labor.

## 🤖 Operational Structure
This repository is managed via a **GitOps** workflow. Content is not deployed manually.

1.  **Content Creation:** The **Content Guild** autonomously generates content (blog posts, social copy, whitepapers) in the `/content` directory based on the active campaign.
2.  **Strategic Review:** The **Executive Council** (Starling, Logos, River) reviews performance data and proposes weekly campaigns in the `/campaigns` directory.
3.  **Chairman Approval:** The Chairman (@servathadi) approves or rejects proposed campaign strategies via Telegram.
4.  **Autonomous Merge & Deploy:** Upon approval, a **GitHub Agent** merges the campaign branch into `main`. This triggers a GitHub Action in `/.github/workflows` to build and publish the content to the live `mumega-web` presence.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Performance is tracked autonomously by agents monitoring our analytics stack.
- **Primary:** Growth in qualified leads for "AI Employee" deployments.
- **Secondary:** Increase in organic traffic for "Sovereign Workforce" and "Digital Twin" topics.
- **Tertiary:** Topical Authority score for "AI in DAOs" and "Future of Work".
